                <section>
                    God of War 4 marked a bold new chapter in the iconic PlayStation series.
                    Moving from Greek to Norse mythology, the game introduced a deeper and more emotional story for Kratos.
                    With breathtaking visuals and seamless combat mechanics, it set new standards for action-adventure games.
                    The bond between Kratos and his son Atreus added powerful storytelling depth rarely seen in the genre.
                    Praised by fans and critics alike, God of War 4 stands as one of the greatest games of its generation.
